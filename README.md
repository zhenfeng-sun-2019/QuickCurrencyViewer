# At first
This Document explains some of my idea on creating this project.


### The original Functional Requirements:
- [ ] Exchange rates must be fetched from: https://currencylayer.com/documentation 
   -> Yes, it is done.
   
- [ ] User must be able to select a currency from a list of currencies available from the API
   -> Yes, it is done.

- [ ] User should then see a list of exchange rates for the selected currency
   -> Yes, it is done.
   
- [ ] Rates should be persisted locally and refreshed no more frequently than every 30 minutes (to limit bandwidth usage)
   -> Yes, it is done.

### UI Suggestion:
- [ ] Some way to select a currency
   -> I designed a way to select Source and Target currency from 2 seperated list. 
      I think it is a simple way to select. 
      
- [ ] A list/grid of exchange rates
   -> I designed a simple list to show the selected exchange rates. 
   
- [ ] It doesn't need to be pretty, it just
needs to be functional ;)
   -> Yes. I understand. I did not spend much time refining the UI. I spend more time make the applicatin functiona and stable.

### What we're looking for:
- [ ] An App that meets the Functional Requirements above
    -> Yes. I think it meets all the basic requirments.
    
- [ ] Your coding style! Show us how you like to write your code
    -> The most thing I care about when I coding is the readablity of the code. 
       Even for a reader does not have much knowledge on Java laguage, he should be able to understand the code (as the natural lauguage).
- [ ] Architecture, how you've structured your code
    -> I have a class diagram to explain my idea:
    (ClassDiagram.png)
- [ ] Principles, how you belive code should be written
